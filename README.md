## 1. Project Summary
This project is an exercise on what a personal portfolio for the character Tara Gregson from the TV series "United States of Tara" would look like. Tara Gregson is a woman that struggles to find a balance between her dissociative identity disorder and raising a dysfunctional family. Tara's multiple personalities include "T" the wild-child teenager, "Buck" the rough and tumble biker dude, and "Alice" the type-A homemaker.

So, the main question is how would she manage to showcase her skills and projects without her alters showing up? If they do manifest, how can I translate them into her personal portfolio?
