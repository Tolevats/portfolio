## 1. Project Summary
This project is an exercise on what a personal portfolio for the character Tara Gregson from the TV series "United States of Tara" would look like. Tara Gregson is a woman that struggles to find a balance between her dissociative identity disorder and raising a dysfunctional family. Tara's multiple personalities include "T" the wild-child teenager, "Buck" the rough and tumble biker dude, and "Alice" the type-A homemaker.
