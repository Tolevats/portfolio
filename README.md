## 1. Project Summary
This project is an exercise on what a personal portfolio for the character Tara Gregson from the TV series "United States of Tara" would look like. The main question is how would she manage to showcase her skills and projects without her alters showing up? If they do manifest, how can I translate them into the portfolio?

The portfolio is a responsive web page that includes sections such as personal information (name and brief description), skills, completed projects, and a contact form.
